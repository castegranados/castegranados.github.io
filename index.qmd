I am a Research Fellow at the [Instituto de Iberoamérica](https://iberoame.usal.es/) of the [University of Salamanca](https://www.usal.es/) (Spain). At Salamanca, I am also a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science. During spring 2024, I was a Visiting Fellow at [LAPOP Lab](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/) (Vanderbilt University).I hold a B.A. in International Relations from the Comillas Pontifical University of Madrid, and an M.A. in Latin American Studies from the University of Salamanca.

My research focuses on political attitudes, inequality, public opinion, and the political inclusion of racialized groups. 

My dissertation addresses how ethno-racial inequalities and different social mobility experiences influence political trust across Latin America. 

Some of my research has been published in _Latin American Politics and Society_, _Bulletin of Latin American Research_, and _Revista de Ciencia Política_, among others.
